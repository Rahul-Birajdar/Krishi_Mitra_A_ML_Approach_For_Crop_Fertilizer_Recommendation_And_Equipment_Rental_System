• Recommends suitable fertilizers based on soil nutrients (N, P, K).  

✅ Equipment Rental System-  
• Rent farm equipment such as tractors, harvesters, cultivators, trailers, and sprayers.  
• Pricing calculated on an hourly basis, adjustable by the user.  

✅ Weather Forecasting-  
• Shows current and 7-day weather forecasts including temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind speed, and pressure.  
• Real-time data integration using sensors and OpenWeatherMap API.  

✅ Government Scheme Access-  
• Provides information on relevant agriculture-related government schemes.  

✅ Multi-language Support-  
• Available in English, Hindi, and Marathi.  
• Interface adapts dynamically based on language selection using GetX.  

✅ Secure User Authentication-  
• Firebase Authentication for sign-up, login, and profile management.
